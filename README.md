# fresh-mac

I created this to set up a new Mac or fresh macOS install.

Create a directory named `fresh-mac`, clone the repo, then run `install`.

Very much a living, breathing work in progress. I'm learning by doing. I will flesh out the README more later.

FEEDBACK WELCOME/REQUESTED

TODO:
Figure out how to make it create the directory in your Home folder, clone there, and then cd into it.
